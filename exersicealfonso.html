    <dt>Adobe Acrobat Reader</dt>
    <dd>Acrobat Reader is software that allows you to view a PDF document (a document that can be seen but not changed). It can be downloaded free of charge from Adobe.</dd>
    <dt>Boot (re-boot)</dt>
    <dd>To boot (or re-boot) is to load and initialise the operating system on a computer. Think of it as starting up your computer. In Windows you can use the key combination CTRL and ALT and DEL as a "soft" boot. This means restarting the computer rather than turning it completely off and on again, which could cause damage to your computer's hard disk under some circumstances.</dd>
    <dt>Cache</dt>
    <dd>When you download (read) a web page, the data is "cached," meaning it is temporarily stored on your computer. The next time you want that page, instead of requesting the file from the web server, your web browser just accesses it from the cache, so the page loads quickly. The downside to this is that if the cached web page is often updated, you may miss the latest version. If you suspect that the web page you're seeing is not the latest version, use the "refresh" button on your browser.</dd>
    <dt>Device driver</dt>
    <dd>A device driver is a small program that allows a peripheral device such as a printer or scanner to connect to your PC.</dd>
    <dt>Ethernet</dt>
    <dd>Ethernet is the most common way of connecting computers on a network with a wired connection. It is a type of local area network (LAN) technology, providing a simple interface for connecting multiple devices</dd>
    <dt>Firewall</dt>
    <dd>A firewall is a barrier that acts as a security system to protect trusted computer systems and networks from outside connections and untrusted networks, such as the Internet.</dd>
    <dt>Gateway</dt>
    <dd>A point within a network that interconnects with other networks</dd>
    <dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>Hyper-text markup language (HTML) is a set of symbols inserted into files intended for display on the world wide web. The symbols tell web browsers how to display words and images - e.g. which colour, font and type size to use - and they direct it to link to other pages on the world wide web via hyperlinks.</dd>
    <dt>Internet</dt>
    <dd>A set of interconnected networks that allow computers in different locations to exchange information. The Internet includes services such as the world wide web, electronic mail, file transfer protocol (FTP), chat and remote access to networks and computers.</dd>
    <dt>Java</dt>
    <dd>Java is a programming language that is commonly used in the development of client-server web applications.</dd>
    <dt>Kilobyte</dt>
    <dd>is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix kilo as 1000 (103); per this definition, one kilobyte is 1000 bytes.</dd>
    <dt>LAN</dt>
    <dd>A local area network (LAN) is a system that connects computers and other devices that share a common communications line and wireless link, generally within a limited geographical area such as a home or office building.</dd>
    <dt>Megahertz</dt>
    <dd>Megahertz is the unit used to measure the speed of a computer's processor (e.g. 2.8Ghz)</dd>
    <dt>Nanobyte</dt>
    <dd>is a piece of technology manufactured by Neucom Incorporated which manipulates microscopic particles at the nanoscopic scale (10^ -9 meters).</dd>
    <dt>Operating system</dt>
    <dd>An operating system (OS) is the software that manages all of a computer's processes and allows programs and applications to run. The most prominent operating system is Microsoft Windows. Others include Mac OS X and Linux.</dd>
    <dt>Processor</dt>
    <dd>The processor is the brains of your computer. It is responsible for performing calculations and tasks that make programs work. The faster the processor, the faster the computer works.</dd>
    <dt>Qualcomm</dt>
    <dd>Qualcomm Incorporated is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company that designs and markets wireless telecommunications products and services. It derives most of its revenue from chipmaking and the bulk of its profit from patent licensing businesses.</dd>
    <dt>RAM</dt>
    <dd>Random access memory (RAM) is usually referred to as a computer's "memory" - it stores information used by programs. Generally, the larger your computer's RAM, the more programs it can run at once without slowing down.</dd>
    <dt>Server</dt>
    <dd>A server is a computer that handles requests for data, email, file transfers, and other network services from other computers.</dd>
    <dt>Terabyte</dt>
    <dd>is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The prefix tera represents the fourth power of 1000, and means 1012 in the International System of Units (SI), and therefore one terabyte is one trillion (short scale) bytes. The unit symbol for the terabyte is TB.</dd>
    <dt>URL</dt>
    <dd>A URL (unique resource locator) or web address is the string of characters you type into a browser to access a particular website or other resource on the Internet. (eg. http://www.ourcommunity.com.au )</dd>
    <dt>Virus</dt>
    <dd>A virus is a piece of programming code inserted into other programming to cause damage. Viruses can be sent in many forms but are often transmitted via email messages that, when opened, may erase data or cause damage to your hard disk. Some viruses are able to enter your email system and send themselves to other people in your list of contacts.</dd>
    <dt>Wi-Fi</dt>
    <dd>Wi-Fi is a technology that allows computers and other devices to communicate via a wireless signal. Essentially, it means you can browse the internet without tripping over phone cords.</dd>
    <dt>Zip</dt>
    <dd>To zip files is to archive and compress them into one file of smaller size using a program such as WinZip. It's a handy way to make files smaller before sending them via email.</dd>
